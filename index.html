						Hello I'm Josh. In my arms is my <b>baby Nala 🥰</b>. I
						consider myself a <b>life long learner</b> and am a big fan of
						free education. I'm currently in search of a <b>full time
						role for 2021</b>. In simple terms, I'm looking for a
						challenging job, that I will learn and grow a lot from.
						In more specific terms, I've found <b>system engineering</b> to be
						exactly the kind of challenge that interests me.
						Anything to do with synchronization, fault tolerance, or
						system design is super interesting to me

							In my operating systems class, I worked in a group to
							create a synchronized, fault tolerant file server. To
							traverse the file system, we used hand over hand locking
							to safetly maximize concurrency. We provide an interface
							of read, write, create, and delete files to the clients.
							We gracefully managed a file exceeding the size of it's
							disk block by maintaining disk data structures that mapped
							where all the memory of a file lived. We also built a
							secure, robust client to server protocol from scratch!
							The client server protocol involved creating the
							message, breaking it down to bits, encryping the
							message, sending the message using Berkley sockets, and
							robustly error checking the message on the other side.

							about and designing the OS datastructures needed to
							manage this project. The data structures rougly involve
							maintining queues for CPUs, mutexes, and cv's along with
							managing thread contexts. The library is extremely robust,
							and is able to gracefully handle CPU interrupts at any
							point in time. We learned to use a copious amount of
							assert statements to catch bugs early, and smart print
							statements to make sense of underterministic code. It
							was the most difficult project I've ever done, but it
							taught me so much about debugging, multi-threading
							debugging, code design, and testing. I loved the
							challenge of this project and it made me deeply
