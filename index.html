					topics that weren't covered in my undergraduate career like
					compilers. I want to expand and advance my knowledge in systems

							maximize the amount of concurrent reads and writes. We built the client to server protocol
							from scratch! We created the message system, broke it
							down to bits, then used sockets to send the message, and used error checking on both sides
							as we reinterpretted the bits. To traverse the file
							system we created, we used hand over hand locking to safetly
							maximize concurrency and provide an interface of read, write, create,
							and delete files to the clients.
