           The SUGS (sequential undergraduate graduate program) program gives me the opportunity to complete my graduate degree with one additional year
           after undergrad. The master's of computer science program
            at Michigan is a selective program with a small class size of around 60 students out of an applicant pool north of 1500 (<a class="link"href="https://secure.rackham.umich.edu/academic_information/program_statistics/masters/program.php?id=Computer+Science+%26+Engin.">4% acceptance rate</a>).
           Rather than mastering one discipline of computer science, Michigan gives students the opportunity to study and master all areas of computer science including theory of computation,
           software development, artificial intelligence, and hardware. I'm so excited to have to opportunity to learn more in each disciplines of computer science at Michigan and master the study.<br/><br/>

          In the process of completing my senior year at the University of Michigan! This school has offered me a tremendous opportunity to explore a
          field that I knew nothing about and to grow a passion for a subject that I've come to love.
          The quality of learning at this university has been excellent, and I've had the opportunity to excel and take advantage of many of the courses Michigan offers.
          The University of Michigan is filled with brilliant CS students who have both inspired and taught me so much about my coding.
          It's really amazing how I've gone from nothing to excelling at computer science in such a short time, and I owe a lot of that to this school!

					Perhaps one of my best experiences over my university career. I had the opportunity to study French in Grenoble, France, a beautiful city in the French Alpes.
          I also was matched with the best host family, Les Horlavilles, who tought me so much about not only the French language itself, but the day to day culture of the French.
          A truely amazing experience which has inspired me to continue learning French for a lifetime! <br/><br/>

           is a large MMO that requires strong and stable server side action. Over 30 players connect per game! Some of my projects
           include testing DTLS connections between clients and servers, adding ways for the client to handle specific HTTP headers and result
           statuses, improving server log statements to be more precise and more intuitive, creating bot tests in order to
           test the stability of some of the large servers, restructuring the purchasing transaction api so that it's more maintainable and easier to understand.<br/><br/>

            working with kids and French. It was also very rewarding to watch the kids improve their French each week! <br/><br/>

              At the University of Buffalo, I lead an augmented reality based project that focused on finding a convenient inexpensive
              way for people with strokes to exercise at home. Traditionally, rehabilitation exercises include a piece of paper with instructions
              and maybe a friend to give back amateur feedback. Now, we’ve expanded these exercises to a whole new level with games that are
              fun to play and give realtime feedback.</br>

            An unscripted, uneditted youtube channel of me doing and teaching code.
            The point of it is to show people how computer scietists think naturally rather than in a scripted tutorial.
            This channel is meant for people who have time to sit back and relax, and watch me code in my thinking zone.
            I mainly go over leetcode/interview style problems and concepts. Enjoy!</br>
